"""
Script to determine leader and follower roles.

Takes input from the camera to determine if the current vehicle
should lead or follow based on whether or not there exists an ARTag
in front of the vehicle.

If an ARTag exists, the vehicle will become a follower vehicle.
If an ARTag does not exist, the vehicle will become the leader vehicle.
